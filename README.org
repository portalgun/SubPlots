* Subplots
I want to plot a lot of something with a lot of regularity, with minimal configuration, and I want it to look nice.
I want a supertitle/sgtitle, row and column labels. 
I want my subplots to be tight and hide labels when they are redundant.
I want to change properties for each subplot using a single parameter.
